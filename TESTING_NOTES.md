# Remote Networks Module Implementation Summary

## Module Implementation

We have implemented the following:

1. **API Spec Files**:
   - Created `plugins/module_utils/api_spec/remote_networks.py` - Defines parameters for remote_networks module
   - Created `plugins/module_utils/api_spec/remote_networks_info.py` - Defines parameters for remote_networks_info module

2. **Module Files**:
   - Created `plugins/modules/remote_networks.py` - CRUD operations for remote networks
   - Created `plugins/modules/remote_networks_info.py` - Read operations for remote networks

3. **Documentation Files**:
   - Created `docs/collection/modules/remote_networks.md` - Module documentation
   - Created `docs/collection/modules/remote_networks_info.md` - Info module documentation
   - Updated `docs/collection/modules/index.md` to include links to new modules

4. **Test Files**:
   - Created `tests/test_remote_networks.yaml` - CRUD test playbook
   - Created `tests/test_remote_networks_info.yaml` - Info module test playbook

## Fixed Issues

1. **Client Attribute Name**: 
   - Changed from `client.RemoteNetworks` to `client.remote_network` 
   - The SDK uses singular attribute names

2. **Validation Logic**: 
   - Updated AnsibleModule definition to use required_if for state-specific validation
   - Added proper error handling for delete operations

3. **Folder Requirements**:
   - Updated tests to use "Remote Networks" folder (required by API)

# Remote Networks Testing Notes

## Latest Test Results

The remote networks module tests are failing with the following main errors:

1. **Required arguments for delete**: In the AnsibleModule definition, we've updated required_if to make the delete operation only require name and folder.

2. **Special folder requirement**: Remote networks must be created in a special folder named "Remote Networks". We've updated the tests to use this folder name.

3. **Invalid IPsec tunnel references**: 
   - Error: `Test-Remote-Network-1 -> ipsec-tunnel 'test-tunnel-1' is not a valid reference`
   - This indicates that the ipsec_tunnel parameter must reference an existing IPsec tunnel object
   - To properly test this, we would need to create real IPsec tunnels first
   
4. **BGP Secret Requirement**:
   - Initial error: `protocol.bgp.secret must be a string` 
   - We've added secrets to the BGP configuration in tests

## Testing Environment Limitations

To properly test the remote_networks module, we need:

1. Access to an environment with existing IPsec tunnels
2. A properly configured "Remote Networks" folder
3. Sufficient permissions to create/delete remote networks

For local testing in this environment, the tests will continue to fail because we don't have access to real IPsec tunnel references.
