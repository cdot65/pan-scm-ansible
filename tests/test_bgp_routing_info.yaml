# Playbook for testing Strata Cloud Manager BGP Routing Info module
# Usage: ansible-playbook tests/test_bgp_routing_info.yaml --vault-password-file=tests/.vault_password
#
# Note: This is a placeholder test file that follows the golden template pattern.
# To run this test, the bgp_routing_info module needs to be registered in the SCM SDK.
# The current SDK version does not include the bgp_routing module/service.
# This test will be completed once the SDK supports the bgp_routing module.

          This is a placeholder test file for the BGP Routing Info module.
          The current SCM SDK version does not support the bgp_routing module.
          This test will be completed once the SDK adds support for BGP routing.
          
          The test follows the golden template pattern with:
          - Initial setup and cleanup
          - CREATE configuration for info testing
          - READ operations with different gather_subsets
          - UPDATE and read operations to test different settings
          - Final cleanup
