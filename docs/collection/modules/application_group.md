## Overview

The `application_group` Ansible module provides functionality to manage application group objects in 
Palo Alto Networks' Strata Cloud Manager (SCM). This module allows you to create, update, and delete
application groups that can contain multiple application objects. Application groups simplify
security policy configuration by allowing you to reference multiple applications as a single object.

## Core Methods

## Basic Configuration

The Application Group module requires proper authentication credentials to access the Strata Cloud Manager API.

```yaml
- name: Basic Application Group Configuration
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    provider:
      client_id: "your_client_id"
      client_secret: "your_client_secret"
      tsg_id: "your_tsg_id"
      log_level: "INFO"
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure an application group exists
      cdot65.scm.application_group:
        provider: "{{ provider }}"
        name: "web-apps"
        members:
          - "ssl"
          - "web-browsing"
        folder: "Texas"
        state: "present"
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating Application Groups

Application groups allow you to organize related applications together for simplified policy management.

### Basic Application Group

This example creates a simple application group with a few members.

```yaml
- name: Create a basic web applications group
  cdot65.scm.application_group:
    provider: "{{ provider }}"
    name: "web-apps"
    members:
      - "ssl"
      - "web-browsing"
    folder: "Texas"
    state: "present"
```

### Comprehensive Application Group

This example creates a more comprehensive application group with multiple related applications.

```yaml
- name: Create a comprehensive collaboration applications group
  cdot65.scm.application_group:
    provider: "{{ provider }}"
    name: "collaboration-apps"
    members:
      - "ms-teams"
      - "zoom"
      - "webex"
      - "slack"
      - "google-meet"
      - "skype"
      - "whatsapp"
    folder: "Texas"
    state: "present"
```

### Updating Application Groups

When updating an application group, you must provide the complete list of members. Any existing
members not included in the update will be removed from the group.

```yaml
- name: Update web applications group membership
  cdot65.scm.application_group:
    provider: "{{ provider }}"
    name: "web-apps"
    members:
      - "ssl"
      - "web-browsing"
      - "http"
      - "https"
    folder: "Texas"
    state: "present"
```

### Deleting Application Groups

This example removes application groups from the system.

```yaml
- name: Remove application groups
  cdot65.scm.application_group:
    provider: "{{ provider }}"
    name: "{{ item }}"
    folder: "Texas"
    state: "absent"
  loop:
    - "web-apps"
    - "collaboration-apps"
```

## Managing Configuration Changes

After creating, updating, or deleting application groups, you need to commit your changes to apply them.

```yaml
- name: Commit changes
  cdot65.scm.commit:
    provider: "{{ provider }}"
    folders: ["Texas"]
    description: "Updated application group definitions"
```

## Error Handling

It's important to handle potential errors when working with application group objects.

```yaml
- name: Create or update application group with error handling
  block:
    - name: Ensure application group exists
      cdot65.scm.application_group:
        provider: "{{ provider }}"
        name: "web-apps"
        members:
          - "ssl"
          - "web-browsing"
        folder: "Texas"
        state: "present"
      register: group_result
      
    - name: Commit changes
      cdot65.scm.commit:
        provider: "{{ provider }}"
        folders: ["Texas"]
        description: "Updated application group definitions"
      
  rescue:
    - name: Handle errors
      debug:
        msg: "An error occurred: {{ ansible_failed_result.msg }}"
        
    - name: Check if error is due to non-existent application
      cdot65.scm.application_info:
        provider: "{{ provider }}"
        folder: "Texas"
      register: all_applications
      
    - name: Display available applications
      debug:
        msg: "Available applications: {{ all_applications.applications | map(attribute='name') | list }}"
      when: all_applications is defined
```

## Best Practices

### Group Organization

- Use descriptive names that indicate the function of the group
- Group applications with similar functions or purposes
- Use a consistent naming convention across application groups
- Limit the number of applications in a group to maintain clarity
- Document the purpose of each application group

### Member Management

- Verify all member applications exist before creating the group
- When updating groups, always provide the complete list of members
- Consider organizing applications into functional groups (web, database, collaboration, etc.)
- Document which applications are included in each group
- Regularly review group membership to ensure it remains relevant

### Policy Implementation

- Use application groups in security policies to improve policy clarity
- Review application group membership regularly as part of security audits
- Consider the impact on existing policies when modifying group membership
- Test policy behavior after making changes to application groups
- Create separate groups for different security zones or requirements

### Performance Considerations

- Balance between using many specific groups versus fewer large groups
- Group commonly used applications together to reduce the number of policy rules
- Consider the impact on policy processing when designing application groups
- Update application groups during maintenance windows if used in active policies
- Monitor policy hit counts to optimize application groupings

### Security Planning

- Create application groups based on risk levels
- Use separate groups for critical applications
- Design application groups to support least-privilege access
- Consider compliance requirements when organizing application groups
- Document security rationale for group composition
